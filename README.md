## What It Does

This project utilizes the YOLOv8 computer vision model—trained to identify cards from a classic deck of cards—to keep a live count of the deck of cards for blackjack card counting.

This is based on the idea that cards numbered 2-6 are a +1, 7-9 are a 0, and 10-A are a -1. If you get a true count of 3, then you should increase your bet size, as you have an edge over the house and will statistically receive higher value cards/face cards.
